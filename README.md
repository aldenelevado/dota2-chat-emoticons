## Installation & Usage

Just copy the `assets` folder into your project and refer to the corresponding gifs in your HTML.

To use the CSS animation version with the PNGs embed the `assets/stylesheets/dota2-chat-emoticons.css` into your HTML and use like this:

```html
<i class="d2ce wink"></i>
<i class="d2ce blush"></i>
<i class="d2ce cheeky"></i>
...
```

> **Recommendation**: For highest quality, use the CSS Animation since PNG supports alpha.

## Update Workflow

In case Valve adds more emoticons:

You will need graphicscmagick/imagemagick (`apt-get install graphicsmagick` on Debian/Ubuntu) and Ruby (get it e.g. via [rvm.io](http://rvm.io)) to run the generator.

1. Run `bundle` to get the required packages for the generator
2. Run `ruby generator.rb`

> **Important**: If you plan to update this README, update the file `src/README.md.eruby` since the README will be generated from it
